        <p class="electric-section-one-part-one-paragraph">
          Modern washing machines can clean clothes effectively at lower
          temperatures. Changing from 40°C to 30°C means you could get 3 cycles
          instead of 2 using the same amount of energy, depending on your
          washing machine.

        <p class="electric-section-one-part-two-paragraph">
          Be sure to wait and accumulate enough laundry so that it fills your
          washing machine's tub before you run a cycle. In the long term this
          practice will save electricity and money.

        <p class="electric-section-one-part-three-paragraph">
          Using your tumble dryer less could save you £70 a year. While having a
          dryer is convenient and fast, each load uses a fair amount of energy
          (and you may already be feeling the pinch on your latest billing
          statement). On average a family of four does upwards of six loads a
          week—sometimes more. If you’re looking for ways to save money, one
          option to consider looking into is hanging your clothes on an airer.
