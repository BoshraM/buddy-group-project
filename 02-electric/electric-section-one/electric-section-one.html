          Modern washing machines can clean clothes effectively at lower
          temperatures. Changing from 40°C to 30°C means you could get 3 cycles
          instead of 2 using the same amount of energy, depending on your
          washing machine.

        <p class="electric-section-one-part-three-content">
          If your family is anything like mine, you do a lot of laundry. Our
          family of four does upwards of six loads a week—sometimes more. While
          having a dryer is convenient and fast, each load uses a fair amount of
          energy (and you may already be feeling the pinch on your latest
          billing statement). If you’re looking for ways to save money, one
          option to consider looking into is hang your clothes on an airer.
