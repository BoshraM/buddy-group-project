          <li class="water-section-three-collapsible-list-item">Watering cans can significantly reduce the amount of water used (compared to sprinklers) whilst getting the desired amount to your plants.</li>

            <li class="water-section-three-collapsible-list-item">Use mulch and bark in your garden, it will help to reduce evaporation by up to 75%.</li>
            <li class="water-section-three-collapsible-list-item">Think about mixing some drought-resistant bedding and perennial plants to your garden to add a bit of diversity and resilience in the summer.</li>
            <li class="water-section-three-collapsible-list-item">Sprinkle hydrogels in the garden and in hanging baskets. These drought relief products are known to aid the slow release of water over time, reducing the need to water the garden frequently.</li>
            <li class="water-section-three-collapsible-list-item">Check the weather before you water. Many plants can go at least a day without watering, and if you know rain is forecast for tomorrow then it's ok to give it a miss today.</li>
