          It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by
          the readable content of a page when looking at its layout.

            The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less
            normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using 'Content here,
            content here', making it look like readable English. Many desktop
            publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as
            their default model text, and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will
            uncover many web sites still in their infancy. Various versions
            have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, sometimes on
            purpose (injected humour and the like).
