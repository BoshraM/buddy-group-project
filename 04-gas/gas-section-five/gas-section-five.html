                Unfortunately, switching energy providers to find a cheaper 
                energy deal is pretty much a thing of the past since OfGem began 
                increasing the energy price cap. However, while savings are likely 
                to be minimal, every penny counts with how to lower a gas bill, 
                so it's worth learning the difference between standard 
                variable and fixed rate energy tariffs.

                If you're about to come out of a fixed-rate tariff 
                contract, it could be worth considering how to switch 
                energy suppliers or contacting your current supplier to make 
                sure you're on the best tariff for your home's energy usage 
                and comparing it with competitor providers.
