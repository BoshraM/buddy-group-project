        Good insulation is key to making your home more energy efficient. 
        If you can maximise the thermal performance of your roof, walls, 
        floor, windows and doors, that will give you the best possible 
        foundation for becoming a low-energy household.

        When it comes to insulating your house, your roof should be 
        the first place you look to. A roof can be responsible for more 
        than 35 per cent of home heat loss. Roof insulation is the cheapest 
        and quickest way to stop heat escaping. 
        Around a third of the heat in an insulated home is lost through 
        the walls according to the Energy Saving Trust. Most homes in 
        the UK have either solid walls that can be insulated from the 
        inside or outside, or cavity walls, which have a gap that can be 
        filled with insulation.

        Floor insulation can lower your gas bill. For newer homes, 
        it will most likely have solid concrete floors, onto which 
        you can add a layer of rigid insulation, whereas older homes 
        with suspended timber floors can be insulated by fitting a layer 
        of mineral wool under the floorboards. 

        Use draught excluder tape for a quick fix. It helps stop 
        draughts coming in through windows and gaps between doors, 
        and throwing down an extra rug or two will also help chilly rooms.
