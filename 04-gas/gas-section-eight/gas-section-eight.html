        Another way to work out how to lower your gas bill is a yearly 
        service by a Gas Safe Registered engineer. Sticking to the recommended 
        amount for how often your boiler should be serviced will ensure that it's 
        working at maximum capacity. During a service, the engineer will check, 
        clean and replace parts and catch any potential problems before the system 
        breaks down.

        Keeping a system maintained doesn't just help lower a gas bill, it will keep 
        it both safe and working efficiently. An efficient boiler uses less energy 
        to heat a house, which means regular services can help keep energy costs lower.

        Not having your boiler serviced could lead to faults, higher energy bills, 
        and your warranty ending early.
