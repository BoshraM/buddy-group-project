          Knowledge is power, and apps like Hugo Energy give you a clear 
          display of how you use your gas on a daily basis. Also having 
          an app on your phone acts as a helpful reminder - seeing it
          day to day on your phone will keep bills top of mind. 
          The app shows how often your boiler is coming on and if 
          you can reduce the periods it comes on for and the amounts of 
          times it comes on.
