        As well as knowing when you should turn your heating off for good,
        be aware that it's a myth that you should leave your heating on low
        all day. Whether you use a timer or manually turn it on,you can 
        lower your gas bill by making sure your heating is only on when you 
        need it or you'll be throwing money away.
