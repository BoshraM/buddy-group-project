                According to Moneysavingexpert.com, for each degree you cut the 
                hermostat you can expect to cut your energy bills by around four percent. 
                That's about Â£65 a year on average for a typical home.

                The World Health Organisation says that 18 degrees is enough for healthy 
                adults, with slightly higher temperatures needed for the very old or young. 
                So consider popping on a jumper at home and seeing what temperature your 
                household is comfortable at.

                If you're wondering about the most efficient way to heat your home and 
                how to lower a gas bill, it's best to tailor it to your lifestyle. 

                Due to the government's current pandemic advice, we are all currently at 
                home for the majority of our day. So think about keeping your home at a
                comfortable temperature for you and your family, but remember that you 
                can wear layers too to save cash in the long run.
