        Ever find the water that comes out of your taps is too hot to touch? 
        Then you're likely to be wasting gas and therefore not helping yourself 
        with how to lower a gas bill. Try turning the water temperature on your 
        boiler down a few degrees until you reach the optimum temperature.
      </p>
      <p class="gas-section-one-content">
        You should have the option to lower the temperature of the hot water that 
        comes out of your taps and shower heads which, over weeks and months, will 
        help you save energy. If your hot water could be slightly lower, it's well 
        worth turning the dial down a tad.
