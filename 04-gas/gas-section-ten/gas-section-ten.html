      <p class="gas-section-ten-content">
        Though a new boiler can be expensive (usually upwards of £1,000), they are a 
        good investment as a newer model will significantly cut your bills. Heating 
        company Vaillant agrees, stating a 30 per cent reduction in bills for 
        homeowners who invest in one of its energy-efficient boilers.

        Modern boilers are all condensing boilers and have a large heat exchanger. 
        This means more heat is recovered and cooler gases are sent up the flue, 
        making it more efficient. Put it into numbers, new A-rated boilers 
        (any boiler over a 90 per cent efficiency) can give you 90p or more worth 
        of heat for every £1 you put in.
        
        To the contrary, this is 60-80p for every £1 in older models.
        Replacing your old boiler also has benefits for the environment. 
        This is because a more efficient boiler will use less fuel to heat your 
        house, reducing your carbon footprint.
