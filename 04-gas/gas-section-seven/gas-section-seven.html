            <p class="gas-section-seven-content"> 
                There are lots of appliances that draw power even when they're on standby. 
                Figures published by British Gas suggest that UK households waste an 
                average of £30 a year powering appliances that they're not even using. 
                Whereas Energy Saving Trust believes you can save even more.

                If you make sure that everything is switched off at the wall when 
                you've finished with it you could save around £40 a year on your 
                energy bills and 50 kg of CO2. 

                This sneaky energy usage is known as vampire power. To combat this, you 
                could invest in a standby saver, which is a simple solution 
                to help you navigate the minefield of energy wastage. 
                Plug all your appliances into a standby saver and then programme 
                it to respond to a single remote control. It will also automatically cut 
                the power to an appliance when it realises it has gone into standby mode.

                Tech can actually help with how to lower a gas bill here, too. You can 
                buy smart outlets so that you can switch power on and off from 
                anywhere.
